           <p>Finding plagiarized parts of an assignment is very slow work for lecturers and sometimes they donâ€™t even notice that an assignment has been plagiarized. Even with a limited number of texts it relies on the lecturer's ability to read and remember every submission. As the process of finding plagiarized parts in assignment is based on the lecturer's ability to remember all that he or she has read, the results may be incomplete. Some clear cases of copy and paste may easily be overlooked. And since the workload cannot be shared between multiple assistants. Thus, we are introducing system for checking Plagiarism in assignments.</p>
